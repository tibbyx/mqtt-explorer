Currently there are three labs:

- old_server
    - gofiber as back-end and currently no frontend
- 0b1
    - fyne as both front-end and back-end.
    - I will probably abandon it though.
- 0b10
    - go-app as both front-end and back-end
    - it builds wasm and has the html + css flexibility
    - builds to web browsers
